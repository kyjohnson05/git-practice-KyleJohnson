After reviewing my commit history, the only issues I've encountered were not seeing pull requests made from my partner and the suggestions.md file he created on my side of the repository. The way I handled this was by discussing the issues with him and finding the pull request afterward.
When practicing reverting a commit, I used GitHub Desktop to revert an edit I made in my Read Me file while trying to resolve the conflict I made. All the reversion did was remove, "Owner:", as I found it didn't look well with the rest of the file when introducing myself.
