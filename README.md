# Owner: My name is Kyle Johnson
# My favorite programming language is C++ (for now) as I am able to create many fun projects with it unlike the other languages I've practiced (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Python).
# Fun Fact: I can see the future in my sleep and forget about the dream until the event happens in real life. It's similar to deja vu, but the difference is I actually saw the moment beforehand.
